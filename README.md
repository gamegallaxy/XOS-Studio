XOS Studio Server Edition Install

first check the compatibility of your system below:
  
 windows 7,8.1,10,11
 8gb of RAM, a processor with dual core minimum
 and 1,5Gb of video memory, for the storage I recommend 512GB in SSD minimum.

in a second time download installer from mega.nz  

launch the installer and that's it.

If you encounter any graphical display bugs, make sure that Windows launches XOS Server in application mode.
